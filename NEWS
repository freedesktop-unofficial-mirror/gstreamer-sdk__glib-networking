2.30.2
======
  * gnutls
	* Added another G_TLS_ERROR_NOT_TLS (aka "dumb server, try
	  falling back from TLS to SSLv3") case, when the handshake
	  completes but then packets after that don't decrypt
	  correctly. (Dan, #662104)

	* Fixed a crash when passing a NULL GError to
	  g_tls_file_database_new(). (Dan)

  * proxy/gnome
	* Fixed configure check so that "--without-gnome-proxy" works.
	  (Alexandre Rostovtsev, #662203)

	* Fixed tests to only build the gnome proxy test if we're
	  building the gnome proxy. (Kalev Lember, #662085)

2.30.1
======
  * Fixed a crash when passing a NULL GCancellable to
    g_tls_connection_close_async() (Dan, #659786)

  * Fixed ignore_hosts handling in GProxyResolverGnome (Dan, #655581)

  * Fixed handling of self-signed CA certificates in
    GTlsDatabaseGnutls (Dan, #660508)

	Telugu

2.30.0
======

	Thai

2.29.92
=======
  * New/updated translations:
	Belarusian, Tamil, Japanese

  * gnutls: Fixed a problem when linking against GNUTLS 3.0, where
    connections would sometimes return the error "The TLS connection
    was non-properly terminated". (Dan Winship, #659233)

  * gnutls: Plugged a few memory leaks (Dan Winship)

2.29.18
=======
  * gnutls: fixed two rehandshaking bugs; one in which a client
    would erroneously report an error after successfully rehandshaking
    (Igor Makarov, #653645), and one where initiating an asynchronous
    rehandshake on the server side would send illegal packets and
    cause the client to disconnect (Dan Winship).

  * gnutls: made GTlsDatabaseGnutls and GTlsFileDatabaseGnutls
    properly cancellable (Stef Walter)

  * gnutls: fixed the client-side session cache to not share session
    IDs between different virtual hosts on the same IP address, which
    caused problems with some servers. (Dan Winship, #581342)

  * tls: Fixed up the tls test program so it can be run from "make
    check" (Stef Walter)

  * New translations:
	Persian

2.29.15
=======
  * gnutls: implement GTlsDatabase (Stef Walter, #636572)

  * gnutls: override minimum key length, to allow connecting to HTTP
    servers with very small keys (eg, on some embedded devices). (Dan
    Winship, #652284).

  * gnutls: use %COMPAT mode, which makes GNUTLS behave more like
    OpenSSL/NSS/Windows in a few ways, making it work with certain
    broken HTTP servers. (Dan Winship, part of #581342)

  * gnutls: fixed a crash when passed a NULL GError (Dan Winship)

2.29.9
======
  * Optimized GDBus usage in PACRunner (davidz)

  * Fixed a race condition in GProxyResolverGnome (davidz)

  * Changed configure to --enable-maintainer-mode by default,

======
  * New/updated translations:
	Basque, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (Traditional), Danish,

2.28.4
======
  * Added a new proxy backend, GProxyResolverGnome, that uses
    GSettings and the network proxy schemas from
    gsettings-desktop-schemas to provide proxy information (and using
    a new D-Bus service provided by the libproxy backend to provide
    PAC/WPAD support).

    If you are building glib-networking in a GNOME 3.0 environment,
    you should make sure that gsettings-desktop-schemas.pc is
    available when building, so that this backend gets built.

  * gnutls: updated GTlsClientConnectionGnutls for :accepted-cas type
    change (Stef Walter)
  * gnutls: fixed an uninitialized variable (Dan Winship)
